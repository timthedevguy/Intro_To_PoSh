# Jordan is an MVP that I had the honor of working and training with when I first joined Truesec,
# I would say he is soley responsible for opening my eyes to the more advanced capabilities of
# PowerShell, before I met Jordan I had used it on and off for simple move scripts and such. I 
# used C# for everything up to that point.

# This training manual is his work and I'm just the delivery method, I may add my own experiences
# if they are helpful.  Jordan now works at Patch My PC and you may have the pleasure of talking
# to him if you interact with Patch My PC at some point.
